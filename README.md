# Sector 09

Welcome to Sector 09, a Halo 3: ODST themed firefight for Halo Custom Edition. You will learn
quickly in Sector 09 that there are a unique variety of enemies that will attack you at every
corner.

Sector 09 promises that every firefight experience is unique. This is because Sector 09 is
designed to spawn enemies randomly.

As mentioned previously, this firefight takes a major inspiration from Halo 3: ODST.
It behaves and functions very similar to Halo 3: ODST. Defeating five waves completes one round,
and defeating three rounds completes one set.The first two sets in Sector 09 are considered to be
"normal" difficulty. However, once you begin Set 3 (Wave 31), "Legendary mode" will activate.
This guarantees that the firefight will send you the most difficult, challenging, and most
importantly fun encounters that Sector 09 has to offer.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains a minimal readaptation of the original Sector 09 map by Nickster5000,
which can be found at https://www.haloce.org/sector09/index.html. The original map required
OpenSauce to run, and this version has been modified to work without OpenSauce.

- No custom shaders
- No VISR effect ability

Other than that, the gameplay experience should be identical to the original map, VISR got
replaced with a flashlight, and the shaders are just vanilla CE shaders.
